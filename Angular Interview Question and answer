There are several ways how Angular components can pass data around
Using @Input and @Output
By injecting parent component through constructor or child components through @ViewChild, @ViewChildren, @ContentChild, @ContentChildren and directly calling componentâ€™s API
Using services (this covers state management libraries like ngrx)
Using router parameters
